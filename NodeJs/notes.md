Node JS MasterClass :--
Hi, This is course page of CoderDost Youtube Channel NODE JS 2023 Course Video Link

How to use this code :
You can download code in 2 ways :

Git Commands

use git clone <repository_url>

checkout branch according to Chapter number git checkout node-1

run npm install inside the root directory before running the code

If you are not comfortable with git, directly download the branch as Zip.

Choose branch related to the Chapter e.g. node-1

run npm install inside the root directory before running the code

NOTE : Code for React JS app is available in final code node-12 branch in folder react-app. It can be used in previous chapters also like chapter-8 etc (however it's the final code, so step-wise code is not available for React, However one can follow the tutorial and make it , sorry for inconvenience)

Chapter 1 - Introduction to Node, NPM, Package.JSON
[[ Chapter Notes ]]
Node JS installation from official site nodejs.org - use only LTS versions
Use terminal / command prompt to check installation : node -v npm -v 
VS Code installation directly from code.visualstudio.com site
Use VS code terminal to run commands
Node REPL interface can be used directly by typing node in terminal / command prompt . Use Ctrl+D to exit interface. Use CTRL+C to exit terminal
Running any JavaScript file from node using node filename.js
Modules are basic containers in Node/JavaScript system. 1 file can be one module in Javascript.
Two type of Module Systems in node JS are - CommonJS module and ES Modules.
- CommonJS Module

//lib.js
exports.sum = function(){}

//index.js
const module = require('./lib.js')
module.sum();
- ES Module

//lib.js
export {sum}

//index.js
import {sum} from './lib.js'
	
FileSystem Module(fs) is one of core modules of Node JS. fs can be used to read/write any file. There are many more core modules in NodeJS which you can check in NodeJS API docs.

Reading files can be Synchronous or Asynchronous. Async is most preferred method in NodeJS. As there is NO blocking of I/O in NodeJS

Node project can be initialized with npm init command which also creates package.json file

package.json is a configuration file for node projects which has scripts, dependencies, devDependencies etc

npm install <package-name> is used to install any online modules available for node on NPM repository online.

nodemon is a package for running node server and track live changes to re-start again.

scripts inside package.json can be used like npm run <script-name> e.g npm run dev. Only for npm start you can avoid run.

use npm install -g <package.json> to install packages globally on your system. Not just in the project but useful all over your system.

Node versions are formatted like 4.1.9 where these are major.minor.patch versions.

you can install all dependencies again using npm install again

package-lock.json has exact versions installed and link of dependencies of each package.

use npm update to update packages safely. npm outdated shows outdated and latets versions of packages installed in your package.json

use npm uninstall <package-name> to uninstall packages from package.json

node_modules should not be shared - you can make .gitignoreto ignore them to be uploaded.

Chapter 2 - Server Concepts with Node - http module
[[ Chapter Notes ]]
HTTP requests
Request object comprises of many properties, but important ones are :

Type of Request : GET, POST, PUT, DELETE etc.
Headers : Meta data sent by your browser like browser name, cookies, authentication information etc.
Query Parameters (url?name=john) : This is used in GET requests to send data to server
Route Params (url/john)
Body data : This is used in POST and other requests to send data to server
HTTP responses
Response object comprises of many properties, but important ones are :

Headers : Meta data sent by your server back to client like server name, content size, last updated time etc.
Response status code (200, 404, 403, 502)
Response body : Actual data to be sent to client : HTML, JS, JSON, CSS, Image etc.
More info
HTTP requests and responses can be tracked from Dev Tools > Network Tab

In Node, we can use core http module to create a Server which listens to requests, modify data in-between and provides responses. Server needs a PORT to be bound to - use only port number > 1024.

Server can simply be said as a function which receives a request and returns a response. [ This is just for understanding]

There are many Headers which exists on request and responses - shared a link below with list of existing headers.

We can use Server to do 3 things:

Static file Hosting : Sending normal files without formatting or modifying.
Server Side Rendering : Mixing data with templates and rendering dynamic views (dynamic web pages)
Web APIs : Sending data via some APIs/ endpoints.
Every Request has one and only one response. If there is more than 1 response which you want to send - you will encounter a error - "Headers already sent"

POSTMAN is a software for doing complex API requests.

[[ Assignments ]]
Assignment 1 : Capture the request which goes when you like a post on facebook (using Chrome network). What are the headers ? What is the payload ?
Assignment 2 : In the chapter we developed a server with only URL switch, but you have to make that more efficient by making it check both METHOD (GET,POST) + URL path
So output of a request with GET /demo will be different from POST /demo [ Use POSTMAN for requests]
Assignment 3 [Challenge] : Try and run 2 different server using the same code you have index.js. You will need to use 2 different ports. But can you do it using the same file and changing PORTS dynamically somehow ?
Assignment 4 [Challenge] : You can also send some data to server using /demo?product=123. where product=123 is called query parameters. Can you capture that data and make the product page work according to the ID (123) . [ This we will do in next chapters using express, but you can give it a try ]

Chapter 3 - Express JS
[[ Chapter Notes ]]
ExpressJS is de-facto Node framework - and used in most Node applications which are used as web server.

You can install express npm install express

Express has few level of methods :

Application methods : e.g. app.use()
Request methods
Response methods
Middleware methods
Router methods
Response methods (res is our response objects)

res.send() - for sending HTML
res.sendFile() - for sending File
res.json - for sending JSON
res.sendStatus(404) - for sending HTTP status only
HTTP Request Types we generally use :

GET
POST
PUT
DELETE
PATCH
API / Endpoints / Routes are used inter-changeably but they are related to server paths.

Middle-ware : Modifies the request before it reaches the next middleware or endpoints.

Sequence of middleware is very important, as first middleware is first traversed by request.

Middle-wares can be used for many use cases, like loggers, authentication, parsing data etc.

Middle-ware can be :

Application level : server.use(middleware)
Router level : server.get('/', middleware, (req,res)=>{})
Built-in middleware : express.json() [ for parsing body data], express.static()[for static hosting]
External Middle-wares - like morgan
Request properties (req is our request object)

req.ip - IP address of client
req.method - HTTP method of request
req.hostname - like google.com / localhost
req.query - for capturing query parameters from URL e.g. localhost:8080 ? query=value
req.body -for capturing request body data (but its needs a middleware for body data decoding)
req.params - for capturing URL parameters for route path like /products/:id
Static Hosting : we can make 1 or more folders as static hosted using express.static middleware. server.use(express.static(< directory >)) Static hosting is like sharing a folder/directory and making its file readable as it is. Note : index.html is default file which would be read in a static hosted folder, if you don't mention any file name.

3 major ways of sending data from client to server via request are :

1. Send data via URL in Query String

This is easiest method to send data and mostly used in GET request.

When you have URL with ?name=Youstart&subject=express at end, it translates in a query string. In query string each key,value pair is separated by = and between 2 such pairs we put &.

To read such data in express you can use req.query :

server.get("/demo",function(req,res){
    console.log(req.query) // prints all data in request object
    res.send(req.query);  // send back same data in response object
})
Assignment 1 :
Make above server with API endpoint /demo as shown above :

Try to call this API in your browser http://localhost:8080/demo?name=Youstart - this will return a response of req.query JSON object

Create 3 query parameters name, age, subject with some values. Check the final output of req.query - can you find all data on server side. Can you send it back to client via res object.

2. Send data via Request Params

In this method you can have a URL with url path like /Youstart/express at end it translates in a param string. In param part string each value is separated by /. As you can see that URL only contains value not the key part of data. key part is decided by the endpoint definition at express server

server.get("/demo/:name/:subject",function(req,res){ console.log(req.params) // prints all data in request object res.send(req.query); // send back same data in response object })

So sequence of values matter in this case. As values sent from client are matched with name and subject params of URL later.

Assignment 2 :
Make above server with API endpoint /demo as shown above :

Try to call this API in your browser http://localhost:8080/demo/Youstart/Express - this will return a response of req.params JSON object

Create 3 URL params name, age, subject . Call the URL and check the final output of req.params - can you find all data on server side. Can you send it back to client via res object.

3. Send data via Request Body

Final method of sending data is via body part of request. We can send data directly to body using URL. We have to either use one of these methods

Use a HTML Form and make method value as POST. This will make all name=value pair to go via body of request.

Use special browsers like POSTMAN to change the body directly. (We will see this example in next classes)

server.post("/demo",function(req,res){
    console.log(req.body) // prints all data in request object
    res.send(req.body);  // send back same data in response object
})

Chapter 4 - REST API using Express JS
[[ Reading Material ]]
HTTP Methods
The HTTP method is the type of request you send to the server. You can choose from these five types below:

GET : This request is used to get a resource from a server. If you perform a GET request, the server looks for the data you requested and sends it back to you. In other words, a GET request performs a READ operation. This is the default request method.

POST This request is used to create a new resource on a server. If you perform a POST request, the server creates a new entry in the database and tells you whether the creation is successful. In other words, a POST request performs an CREATE operation.

PUT and PATCH: These two requests are used to update a resource on a server. If you perform a PUT or PATCH request, the server updates an entry in the database and tells you whether the update is successful. In other words, a PUT or PATCH request performs an UPDATE operation.

DELETE : This request is used to delete a resource from a server. If you perform a DELETE request, the server deletes an entry in the database and tells you whether the deletion is successful. In other words, a DELETE request performs a DELETE operation.

REST API are a combination of METHODS( GET, POST etc) , PATH (based on resource name)

Suppose you have a resource named task, Here is the example of 5 REST APIs commonly available for task.

READ APIs :
GET \tasks : to read all

GET \task\:id : to read a particular task which can be identified by unique id

CREATE APIs :
POST \tasks : to create a new task object (data will go inside request body)
UPDATE APIs :
PUT \task\:id : to update a particular task which can be identified by unique id. Data to be updated will be sent in the request body. Document data will be generally totally replaced.
PATCH \task\:id : to update a particular task which can be identified by unique id. Data to be updated will be sent in the request body. Only few fields will be replace which are sent in request body
DELETE APIs :
DELETE \task\:id : to delete a particular task which can be identified by unique id.
[[ Chapter Notes ]]
REST API is a standard for making APIs.
We have to consider a resource which we want to access - like Product
We access Product using combination of HTTP method and URL style
REST API ( CRUD - Create , Read , Update, Delete) :

CREATE

POST /products - create a new resource (product)
READ

GET /products - read many resources (products)
GET /products/:id - read one specific resource (product)
UPDATE

PUT /products/:id - update by replacing all content of specific resource (product).
PATCH /products/:id - update by only setting content from body of request and not replacing other parts of specific resource (product).
DELETE

DELETE /products/:id - delete a specific resource (product).

Chapter 5 - Backend Directory Structure / MVC / Router
[[ Chapter Notes ]]
MVC (Model-View-Controller) is a pattern in software design commonly used to implement user interfaces (VIEW), data (MODEL), and controlling logic (CONTROLLER). It emphasizes a separation between the software's business logic and display.

In Our Project this will be : Model - Database Schema's and Business logics and rules View - Server Side Templates (or React front-end) Controller - functions attached to routes for modifying request and sending responses. It's a link between the Model and View.

Router

These are like mini-application on which you can make set of Routes independently.
Routers can be attached to main Server App using server.use(router)
Arrange Directory in Server like this :

Controllers - file containing functions which are attached to each route path Routes - files containing routers Models : to be discussed in later chapters Views: to be discussed in later chapters

Chapter 6 - MongoDB - Server / Mongo Shell (CLI) / Mongo Atlas
[[ Reading Material]]
MongoDB is NoSQL database which has a JSON like (BSON data) data storage.

Setting up Database Server and Connecting with Mongo Shell
After installing MongoDB community server package on your system - you will have to start the database server using command :

mongod
This will start MongoDB server on default port 27017. You might have to create a directory for storage in MongoDB - if server asks for storage directory

Once server is started - you can use mongo client to connect to local server

mongo
Now you can use several commands to work with database:

show dbs
This will list all the database in your system

use <dbname>
This will command will let you switch to a particular

Understanding MongoDB structure
Hostname
Database
Collection
Document
Hostname is Database server address - like localhost or db.xy.com. In mongoDB hostname generally uses mongodb protocol to connect. So URLs are generally are of shape : mongodb://localhost:27017

Database are topmost storage level of your data - mostly each application has 1 database - however complex application might have more than 1 databases. Database is something like university database

There can be many collections inside a database - collection is a group of documents of similar kind - students, teachers, courses etc

Finally document is basic entity of storage in Mongod, it looks very similar to an object in JSON. (However it is BSON)

MONGO CLI
Mongo DB community server comes with in-bulit Mongo CLI which can act as a terminal based client. You can use the CRUD functionality from here

Read the commands here

Assignment 1
Try these commands given in Mongo CLI reference docs.
Show database
Use database
Show collection
Create Query (insertOne, insertMany)
Read Query (find, findOne)
Update Query (updateOne)
Delete Query (deleteOne, deleteMany)
Delete database (drop)
Assignment 2
Mongodump and Mongorestore
These utilities comes with community server and can be found in CMD/terminal. They are not the part of Mongo CLI client.

Mongodump command is used to take backup of complete database or some collections
mongodump  --db accounts 
Above command takes backup of database accounts and stores into a directory named dump

Mongorestore command is used to restore database
mongorestore --db accounts dump/accounts
Above command restore your database accounts from backup directory dump

Task : Use these commands on terminal/CMD (not inside mongo client)

Take a backup of database you created in assignment 1.

Restore the backup of database from dump directory.

Using MONGODB NODE.JS DRIVER [ OPTIONAL READING - as we will not use Mongo Driver ]
To install MONGODB NODE.JS DRIVER use this command

npm install mongodb
You can setup database in Node server using following commands :

const MongoClient = require('mongodb').MongoClient;
const assert = require('assert');

// Connection URL
const url = 'mongodb://localhost:27017';

// Database Name
const dbName = 'myproject';

// Use connect method to connect to the Server
MongoClient.connect(url, function(err, client) {
  assert.equal(null, err);
  console.log("Connected correctly to server");

  const db = client.db(dbName);

});
Now this db handle can be used to perform any CRUD operation using MongoDB NodeJS driver.

Mongo Server

You can install MongoDB community server for your system and set the Path to bin folder
You can choose your own database path while starting the mongod server
 mongod --dbpath <path-to-db-directory>
Mongo Compass : UI Client to see mongo server (local or remote)

Mongo Shell : Command-line based mongo client for checking mongo database.

Some Mongo Commands:

Top Level commands :
(run from anywhere inside the shell)

show dbs;
use < database-name > - to choose a database and go inside its prompt
Database CRUD commands :
(run only from inside a database)

CREATE COMMANDS
db.< collectionName >.insertOne( newDocument )
db.< collectionName >.insertMany( documentArray )
READ COMMANDS
db.< collectionName >.find( filterObject ) - to read all docs
db.< collectionName >.findOne( filterObject ) - to read one document
db.< collectionName >.countDocuments( filterObject ) - shows total number of documents.
filter Object : { fieldName : {operator: value}} fieldName : database fields name operator : $eq = equal , $gt= greater than, $lt : less than, $gte = greater than equal, $and and $or operator value : what value we are comparing with operator.

e.g { age : {$gt:5}}. - age is greater than value 5

Cursor functions : These are applied to find() query .

sort( {fieldName: 1}) : 1 for ascending -1 for descending
limit( x ) : only gives x documents
UPDATE COMMANDS
db.< collectionName >.updateOne( filterObject, updateObject, options )
update Objects = { $set : {field: value}}
options : {upsert: true}
Upsert : Update + Insert, when we want a new info to create a new obejcts if no existing object matches filter queries.

db.< collectionName >.replaceOne( filterObject, updateObject ) Overwrites other fields also which are not in updateObject.
DELETE COMMANDS
db.< collectionName >.deleteOne( filterObject )
Projection

Only return selected fields while returning result documents.
db.< collectionName >.find( filterObject, projectionObject ) e.g. {name:1, age:1, id:0} - only show name and age and don't show id

Chapter 7 - Mongoose and REST APIs
[[ Reading Material ]]
You can install mongoose using npm :

npm install mongoose
After installing , you can import mongoose to your project :

const mongoose = require("mongoose");
Connection to Database
To connect mongoose to your database test, you have to use the following commands :

var mongoose = require('mongoose');
await mongoose.connect('mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/test');
Connection can also be stored in a variable to check whether it is connected properly or not. Also to disconnect database later on. You can read more details Here

Schema
Schema is the specification according to which data object is created in Database.

taskSchema which contains title, status, date fields. So every task object saved in database will have these 3 fields according to Schema given

const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const Schema = mongoose.Schema;

const taskSchema = new Schema({
    title:  String,
    status: Boolean,
    date: { type: Date, default: Date.now }    
  });
Many types of data are allowed in Mongoose Schema. The common SchemaTypes are:

String
Number
Date
Boolean
Mixed
ObjectId
Array
You can put a lot of conditions inside the Schema object :

    age: { type: Number, default:18, min: 18, max: 65, required :true }
    // default value of Number is 18 and should be between 18-65, and can't be null or empty
Detailed information on SchemaTypes is Here

Model
Model are similar to classes, they create a Class from Schema. These classes(i.e Models) can be used to create each new database object.

const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const { Schema } =  mongoose;

const taskSchema = new Schema({
    title:  String,
    status: Boolean,
    date: { type: Date, default: Date.now },    
  });
  
const Task = mongoose.model('Task', taskSchema);  //Task Model to create new database objects for `tasks` Collection
Task 1
Connect mongoose to a database named todolist if you don't have a database with this name. Mongoose will create it after you perform any insert operation.

Creata a Schema named taskSchema and model named Task as shown above.

CRUD in Mongoose
Create - new objects
To Create new obejct in database we can use new keyword and create an object from Model. We can use save() function to save the object in database. Unless, you call save function - the object remains in memory. If your collection not yet created in MongoDB, it will created with name of Model pluralized (e.g Task will make a collection named tasks)

server.post("/task",function(req,res){
    let task = new Task();

    task.title = "shopping";
    task.status = true;
    task.date = new Date();

    task.save();
})
Task 2
You have to create an API Endpoint to type POST named /task. It will create a new task item in database whenever called properly. All 3 fields title, status, date must be mandatory (required). If someone is not passing all fields properly, no database entry should be created.

//request body :

{
    "title" : "task1",
    "status" : true,
    "date" :'2010-05-30"     

}

// response body should return the newly created object.

res.json(task);
Check using Mongo Compass/or Mongo Shell that new record in database is created. Also check name of collection. Is is tasks ?

Read objects
To read new obejcts from database, one can use find query or similar queries. find queries also contain some conditions which can restrict what kind of data objects you want to read from database.

server.get("/task/:name",function(req,res){
    Task.findOne({name:req.params.name},function(err,doc){
        console.log(doc)  // this will contain db object
    })
})


server.get("/tasks",function(req,res){
    Task.find({},function(err,docs){
        console.log(docs)  // this is an array which contains all task objects
    })
})
Task 3
You have to create an API Endpoint to type GET named /tasks. It will return all task available in collection tasks.

//request is GET so no data in body :


// response body should return the all db objects of collection tasks.

res.json(tasks);
Check Mongo Compass/or Mongo Shell - if all records are returned in response. How you will change this API to make it return only one database record in which title is matched with title sent in request query.

Update - existing objects
To Update an existing object in database we need to first find an object from database and then update in database. This might be considered as a combination of find and save methods.

There are generally 2 cases in update :

Updating all values and overwriting the object properties completely.
Updating only few values by setting their new values.
First scenario is covered using this query. Here you are overwriting all properties and resulting object will only have name property.

server.put("/task/:name",function(req,res){
    Task.findOneAndReplace({name:req.params.name},{name:'YouStart'},{new:true},function(err,doc){
        console.log(doc)  // this will contain new db object
    })
})
Second scenario is covered using this query. Here you are only changing value of name property in existing object without changing other values in Object.

server.put("/task/:name",function(req,res){
    Task.findOneAndUpdate({name:req.params.name},{name:'YouStart'},,{new:true},function(err,doc){
        console.log(doc)  // this will contain db object
    })
})
Task 4
You have to create an API Endpoint to type PUT named /task/:id. It will update existing task item in database which has ObjectId set to id you have passed.

//request params will have id in URL path :

{
    "title" : "task-changed",
}

// response body should return the newly updated object.

res.json(task);
Check using Mongo Compass/or Mongo Shell that only title of record in database is changed. All other properties remain the same.

Delete - existing objects
To Delete existing object from database we need to first find an object from database and then delete. This might be considered as a combination of find and delete methods.

server.delete("/task/:name",function(req,res){
    Task.findOneAndDelete({name:req.params.name},function(err,doc){
        console.log(doc)  // this will contain deleted object object
    })
})
Task 5
You have to create an API Endpoint to type DELETE named /task/:id. It will delete existing task item in database which has ObjectId set to id you have passed.

//request params will have id in URL path :

// response body should return the deleted object.

res.json(task);
Check using Mongo Compass/or Mongo Shell that the record is deleted or not.

Mongoose connection code
main().catch(err => console.log(err));

async function main() {
  await mongoose.connect('mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/test');
  
  // use `await mongoose.connect('mongodb://user:password@127.0.0.1:27017/test');` if your database has auth enabled
}
Mongoose Schema : Each schema maps to a MongoDB collection and defines the shape of the documents within that collection.
const  productSchema  =  new  Schema({

title: {type:  String, required:  true, unique:  true} ,
description:  String,
price: {type:  Number, min:[0,'wrong price'],required:  true},
discountPercentage: {type:  Number, min:[0,'wrong min discount'], max:[50,'wrong max discount']},
rating: {type:  Number, min:[0,'wrong min rating'], max:[5,'wrong max rating']},
brand: {type:  String,required:  true},
category: {type:  String, required:  true},
thumbnail: {type:  String, required:  true},
images: [ String ]

});
Mongoose Model : model are built using a combination of Schema and name of Collection.
const Product  =  mongoose.model('Product', productSchema);
Mongoose Document - its is instance of a model. so Model is like a class and documents are like its objects. These documents are directly saved in mongoDB.
  const document = new Product();
 // document is actually saved in database after save()
  await document.save();
Mongoose Schema/Model can act as Model of Model-View-Controller concept.

CRUD API and mongoose methods
CREATE :

create product - use **POST ** HTTP Method
   const product = new Product();
   await product.save()
READ :

read all products - use GET HTTP Method
const  products  =  await  Product.find();

const  products  =  await  Product.find({price:{$gt:500}});
read 1 product - use GET HTTP Method
const  product  =  await  Product.findById(id);
UPDATE :

replace product fields (all fields) - use PUT HTTP Method
const  doc  =  await  Product.findOneAndReplace({_id:id},req.body,{new:true})
update only some product fields - use PATCH HTTP Method
const  doc  =  await  Product.findOneAndUpdate({_id:id},req.body,{new:true})
DELETE :

delete 1 product - use DELETE HTTP Method
const  doc  =  await  Product.findOneAndDelete({_id:id})

CORS - Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a standard that allows a server to relax the same-origin policy

we will use CORS package to allow cross origin request from React JS server to NodeJS server as they are on different hosts.
npm install cors
to use cors -
const cors = require('cors');

server.use(cors())
HTML Forms

name attribute on input elements is used to send data keys which are validated with schema in backend.
Build a React Project :
Run npm run build
use build folder to be hosted on public hosting/static hosting
Host a React Project :
you can use build folder of react and add it to static hosting of express. server.use(express.static('build'));

Use Routing in Front-end
use wildcard in express route to point to React single page applications (index.html)

res.sendFile(path.resolve(__dirname,'build','index.html'))
__dirname is a variable

Assignments are after Chapter 9
Chapter 9 - Deploy Live
[[ Chapter Notes ]]
Preparation for deployment

First check whether front-end routes are independent of server, and make all of them relative to /
Connect MongoDB atlas - in-place of mongo local database
How to Deploy to Vercel :
Commit you code on a github account (personal account for free services)
Set Environment Variables on Vercel - like MONGO_URL, PUBLIC_DIR
Put a vercel config file - vercel.json in your project root directory.
After every change, commit your changes - and push code on github.
You have to provide permission for github directory to vercel. It will pickup vercel.json and package.json and deploy your code accordingly.
Check video for more details.

Chapter 10 - Server Side Rendering
[[ Chapter Notes ]]
Server side rendering is done using many templating languages

EJS
Pug
Handlebars
We have used EJS which is one of the most popular one.

Install npm install ejs

Control flow with <% %>
Escaped output with <%= %> (escape function configurable)
<% if (product) { %>
 <h2><%= product.title %></h2>
<% } %>
For passing variable to template engine and render a new page :

const ejs = require('ejs');


ejs.renderFile(path.resolve(__dirname,'../pages/index.ejs'), {products:products}, function(err, str){
    res.send(str); // this is the rendered HTML
});
How to send HTML FORM data to Express
You need to have input boxes have proper name which will be used as key to objects sent to backend. Mostly in form like name=value
use action or for API destination action="/products"
use method or for API type method="POST"
use enctype with value application/x-form-urlencoded
[[ Assignments ]]
Assignment 1 : Create Server rendered page for quotes collection created in 1 of previous assignment. Use a very simple HTML template to display each quote in a list format. You can use other render method of EJS for this task. (not renderFile)

Chapter 11 - Authentication with JWT
Using JWT for generating Auth Tokens
JWT library installation
	`npm install jsonwebtoken`
Use jwt.io to understand 3 parts of JWT - headers, payload, signature
Signing of JWT
jwt.sign(payload, secret) this returns a token

verifying a JWT token
jwt.verify(token, secret) this returns decoded value of payload

We will use HTTP Authorization headers for exchanging these tokens e.g. Authorization = 'Bearer JWT_TOKEN_VALUE'

Using RSA algorithm (public-private key) : check video.

Password Hashing
you can use a library like bcrypt to hash password, so they are not stored in plain text format

Installation :
npm install bcrypt

Hashing
bcrypt.hashSync(userProvidedPassword, saltRounds)

Verifying Password
bcrypt.compareSync(loginPassword, AlreadyHashedPassword)

return true of false based on verification of password

[[ Assignments ]]
Assignment 1 : Try to make a application which stores JWT in localstorage. So that even after you close browser and open site again. Server will still remember you JWT and authenticates you.

Localstorage
SESSION MIDDLEWARE [Optional]
Check Video on Session :

Session middleware is used to store session variable for each user on server side. This middleware can make use of any data storage depending on settings. By default it stores session variables in Memory (RAM).

First install express-session middleware

npm install express-session
Now you can use it in your express server

var server = express()
const session = require('express-session')


server.use(session({
  secret: 'keyboard cat',
  resave: false,
  saveUninitialized: true,
  cookie: { secure: false }   // make secure : true incase you are using HTTPS
}))
Now you can use req.session object to store any value for a particular user in server session. This value will not interact with similar variable of other users.

server.get('/user', function(req, res) {
  if (req.session.views) {
    req.session.views++
    res.json({views:req.session.views})
  } else {
    req.session.views = 1
    res.send('welcome to the session demo. refresh!')
  }
})
Assignment for Sessions
In above example we are initializing a variable session for each user. Write similar code in your server

Checkout if its value increases every time you refresh the page.

Chapter 12 - Mongoose Advanced queries, Node Streams, Events etc.
[[ Chapter Notes ]]
Mongoose Queries
Sorting:

find().sort({fieldname: 1}) // ascending can be 1, asc, ascending , Descending values can be -1, desc, descending

Pagination related queries:

find().limit(pageSize).skip( pageSize*(pageNumber-1)) // where pageSize is number of document results you want to show.

Population

Populate() lets you reference documents in other collections.

const  userSchema  =  new  Schema({
firstName: { type:  String, required:  true },
lastName:  String,
cart:[{ type:  Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref:  'Product' }],
email: {
    type:  String,
    unique:  true,
    validate: {
       validator:  function (v) {
        return /^[\w-\.]+@([\w-]+\.)+[\w-]{2,4}$/.test(v);
          },
       message: (props) =>  `${props.value} is not a valid email!`,
     },
    required:  true,
},
password: { type:  String, minLength:  6, required:  true },
token:  String,
});

//cart populated example
const  user  =  await  User.findById(id).populate('cart');
For More details : Detailed Population Video

Node Events and Event Emitter
const em = new EventEmitter()

em.on(eventName, (payloadData)=>{} ) // listeners

em.emit( eventName , payloadData ) // emit events
Node Streams
A readable stream

const  rr  =  fs.createReadStream('./data.json');

rr.on('data', (data) => { // received data event on every file read
 console.log({data});
});

rr.on('end', (data) => {  // received end of stream event
 console.log({data});
});
Socket in Node (Socket.IO)
Install Socket IO library
npm install socket.io

Server Side Code
const  server  =  express();
const  app  =  require('http').createServer(server);
const  io  =  require('socket.io')(app);

io.on('connection', (socket) => {
console.log('socket',socket.id)

socket.on('msg',(data)=>{ // listener to client-side events 'msg'
console.log({data})
})
socket.emit('serverMsg',{server:'hi'} //emitting 'serverMsg' for Client-side
});

app.listen(port)
Client Side Code
// embeding client-side library which will be downloaded from module installed on Server
<script  src="/socket.io/socket.io.js"></script>

<script>
const  socket  =  io();
console.log('socket',socket.id)

socket.emit('msg',{player:'one'}) // emitting 'msg' to server-side

socket.on('serverMsg',(data)=>{  // listener to server-side events 'serverMsg'
   console.log({data});
})

</script>

[[ Assignments ]]
Assignment 1 :
Make a simple group chat application using Socket.io library.
You need to have a user enter their name in textbox (you can store that in localstorage)
After user enters the name : they can see a text box where they can start entering the text messages.
Display messages from user and others in a simple html list format.
You can align incoming messages from other users to left and your own messages to right side.
Optionally, you can use database to store the old text messages in case you want old chat to be reloaded.
